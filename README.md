# Parallel-IF
Demonstration of the Parallel IF Architecture for Superhet Radios with variable receive bandwidth

This example uses a Si5351 RF generator under the control of an Arduino to generate BFO and VFO signals for a multi-band superhet HF receiver, having two switchable IF frequencies.

User interface is realised through an interrupt-driven rotary encoder, a pair of push buttons and an LCD display.
